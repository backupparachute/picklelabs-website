                <p>Many players, especially those working to move beyond the mid-3s, look for more spin, more power, or a new drill to gain consistency. The truth is that real improvement usually comes from mastering three simple fundamentals that form the base of every reliable shot.</p>
                
                <p>They are simple to understand, but not easy to repeat. Each one connects to the next, shaping how you see the ball, how you move to it, and how you make contact.</p>

                    <h5 class="alert-heading">The Three Fundamentals</h5>
                    <ol class="mb-0">
                        <li>Keep your eyes down through contact</li>
                        <li>Move your feet to meet the ball's fall</li>
                        <li>Hit out in front and stay compact</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
                
                <p>When you build these three habits, your game starts to look calm, controlled, and confident.</p>

                <h2 class="h3 mb-4">1. Keep Your Eyes Down Through Contact</h2>
                
                <p>Many players, even experienced ones, do not truly watch the ball through contact. You see it coming, then just before you hit, your eyes lift to see where it is going. That small lift moves your shoulders and paddle face, and suddenly the shot that felt right ends up in the net or off target.</p>
                
                <p>In tennis, there is a famous image of Roger Federer hitting a forehand. The ball has already left his strings, yet his eyes remain locked on the exact point of contact. His head stays still, his body balanced, and the shot looks effortless. That level of focus is trained, not natural.</p>
                
                <div class="alert alert-warning">
                    <h6 class="alert-heading">Watch This Example</h6>
                    <p class="mb-0">ðŸ‘‰ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/19t5EBQuo6w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Watch Federer's slow-motion forehand example</a></p>
                </div>
                
                <h5 class="mt-4 mb-3">Try this:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Keep your eyes down until you can actually see the blur of the ball leaving your paddle</li>
                    <li>Think "see it leave" as your mental cue</li>
                    <li>Quietly say "hit" at contact to stay centered and focused</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>When you train your eyes to stay down through contact, you keep your head still and your swing path steady. The result is cleaner contact, steadier posture, and far fewer errors from lifting your head too early.</p>

                <h2 class="h3 mb-4">2. Adjust Your Feet to Meet the Ball's Fall</h2>
                
                <p>The problem is not just reaching, it is being in the wrong spot for the right moment. The best contact usually happens after the bounce, right as the ball peaks and begins to fall. That is when the ball slows slightly and control increases.</p>
                
                <p>Good players do not assume they are in position. They move their feet every time the ball crosses the net, even when it feels unnecessary. Those small movements build balance and rhythm.</p>
                
                <h5 class="mt-4 mb-3">Try this:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Move early and lightly so you can meet the ball at the right height</li>
                    <li>Take small adjustment steps to stay balanced and centered</li>
                    <li>Even if you think you are already in the right spot, make a few micro adjustments anyway. The habit of constant movement trains your body to react naturally and keeps you from locking into stiff positions</li>
                    <li>Think "float to the drop" so you are always balanced and ready</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>When you get in the habit of moving your feet for every shot, you start to feel more connected to the ball. You no longer have to reach or force it. Your body and paddle arrive together, which sets you up perfectly for the next key, hitting out in front.</p>
                
                <hr class="my-5">
                
                <h2 class="h3 mb-4">3. Hit Out in Front and Keep It Compact</h2>
                
                <p>For many players working to build consistency, solid contact happens when the ball meets the paddle slightly ahead of the body. A split stance, one foot forward and one slightly back, gives you balance and a clear visual target. Aim to make contact near that lead foot.</p>
                
                <p>Keeping your paddle visible in your peripheral vision during your backswing helps control your swing path. If your paddle slips behind your hip, your motion becomes longer, your timing gets harder to repeat, and your consistency drops. A compact swing keeps control high and recovery quick.</p>
                
                <h5 class="mt-4 mb-3">Try this:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use a simple split stance to stay balanced</li>
                    <li>Make contact near your front foot, slightly out ahead of your body</li>
                    <li>Keep your backswing short enough that your paddle stays within your side view</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>A compact, forward-contact swing produces a smooth, predictable stroke. It scales easily whether you are dinking softly, resetting in the mid court, or driving the ball with pace.</p>
                
                <hr class="my-5">
                
                <h2 class="h3 mb-4">Master the Rules Before You Break Them</h2>
                
                <p>Once these three habits feel natural, your game opens up. You will start to control rallies instead of just reacting. That is when you can add creativity, take the ball earlier, or vary your pace and placement.</p>
                
                <p>Until then, focus on the foundation. Watch it, move to it, and meet it out front.</p>

                    <h5 class="alert-heading">Remember</h5>
                    <p class="mb-0">Simple but not easy, and once you can do it, you are ready to start breaking the rules.</p>
